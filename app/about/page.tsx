              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6 font-serif leading-relaxed">
                Touch & Restored Foundation is a beacon of blessings miraculously birthed out of the abuse of Jacqueline (Jackie) Sinclair as a child alongside her mother, Josephine as a battered woman. Domestic violence created a plague of personal tragedies for them both throughout their lives. Desperate to make sense of this violence, in 2017 Jackie realized that with a team she could make something positively impactful out of her experience as she recognized her world reflected the same pain. After the release of her book, <em>A Child Cries: The Pain of Searching for Love</em>, she searched for a teamâ€”united in accepting God's higher goal. That goal? Simply, a safe haven for the abused & battered. Together, we dedicate our lives in finding, creating & providing resources catering to the needs of those who have suffered.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground font-serif leading-relaxed">
                Grateful for the support our family receives from the community, we are focused on paying our blessings forward. We feel a deep sense of responsibility to make a difference in the lives of all the Jackies we will never know and the Josephines we may never meet. Touch & Restored Foundation is committed to restore lives, and revive hope.
