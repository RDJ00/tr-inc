                Touch & Restored Foundation is a beacon of blessings miraculously birthed out of the abuse of Jacqueline (Jackie) Sinclair as a child alongside her mother, Josephine as a battered woman. Domestic violence created a plague of personal tragedies for them both throughout their lives. Desperate to make sense of this violence, in 2017 Jackie realized that with a team she could make something positively impactful out of her experience as she recognized her world reflected the same pain. After the release of her book, <em>A Child Cries: The Pain of Searching for Love</em>, she searched for a teamâ€”united in accepting God's higher goal. That goal? Simply, a safe haven for the abused & battered. Together, we dedicate our lives in finding, creating & providing resources catering to the needs of those who have suffered.

                Grateful for the support our family receives from the community, we are focused on paying our blessings forward. We feel a deep sense of responsibility to make a difference in the lives of all the Jackies we will never know and the Josephines we may never meet. Touch & Restored Foundation is committed to restore lives, and revive hope.
