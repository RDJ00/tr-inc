                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                  Domestic violence is a pattern of behaviors used by one partner to maintain power and control over
                  another partner in an intimate relationship. It includes behaviors that physically harm, arouse fear,
                  prevent a partner from doing what they wish, or force them to behave in ways they do not want.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                  Domestic violence can happen to anyone regardless of race, age, sexual orientation, religion, gender,
                  socioeconomic background, or education level. It can include physical violence, sexual violence,
                  threats, emotional abuse, and economic deprivation.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Understanding the dynamics of domestic violence is the first step toward prevention and intervention.
